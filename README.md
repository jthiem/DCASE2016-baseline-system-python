1. Introduction
===============
This document describes the Python implementation of the baseline systems for the [Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2016 (DCASE2016) challenge](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/) **[tasks 1](#11-acoustic-scene-classification)** and **[task 3](#12-sound-event-detection)**. The challenge consists of four tasks:

1. [Acoustic scene classification](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/task-acoustic-scene-classification)
2. [Sound event detection in synthetic audio](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/task-sound-event-detection-in-synthetic-audio)
3. [Sound event detection in real life audio](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/task-sound-event-detection-in-real-life-audio)
4. [Domestic audio tagging](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/task-audio-tagging)

The baseline systems for task 1 and 3 shares the same basic approach: [MFCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) based acoustic features and [GMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model) based classifier. The main motivation to have similar approaches for both tasks was to provide low entry level and allow easy switching between the tasks. 

The dataset handling is hidden behind dataset access class, which should help DCASE challenge participants implementing their own systems.

The [Matlab implementation](https://github.com/TUT-ARG/DCASE2016-baseline-system-matlab) is also available. 

#### 1.1. Acoustic scene classification

The acoustic features include MFCC static coefficients (with 0th coefficient), delta coefficients and acceleration coefficients. The system learns one acoustic model per acoustic scene class, and does the classification with maximum likelihood classification scheme. 

#### 1.2. Sound event detection

The acoustic features include MFCC static coefficients (0th coefficient omitted), delta coefficients and acceleration coefficients. The system has a binary classifier for each sound event class included. For the classifier, two acoustic models are trained from the mixture signals: one with positive examples (target sound event active) and one with negative examples (target sound event non-active). The classification is done between these two models as likelihood ratio. Post-processing is applied to get sound event detection output. 

2. Installation
===============

The systems are developed for [Python 2.7.0](https://www.python.org/). Currently, the baseline system is tested only with Linux operating system. 

Run to ensure that all external modules are installed

    pip install -r requirements.txt

**External modules required**

[*numpy*](http://www.numpy.org/), [*scipy*](http://www.scipy.org/), [*scikit-learn*](http://scikit-learn.org/)
`pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn`

Scikit-learn (version >= 0.16) is required for the machine learning implementations.

[*PyYAML*](http://pyyaml.org/)
`pip install pyyaml`

PyYAML is required for handling the configuration files.

[*librosa*](https://github.com/bmcfee/librosa)
`pip install librosa`

Librosa is required for the feature extraction.
Use cournape/samplerate (from github) instead of scikit.samplerate to get high quality resampling.

3. Usage
========

For each task there is separate executable (.py file):

1. *task1_scene_classification.py*, Acoustic scene classification
3. *task3_sound_event_detection_in_real_life_audio.py*, Real life audio sound event detection

Each system has two operating modes: **Development mode** and **Challenge mode**. 

All the usage parameters are shown by `python task1_scene_classification.py -h` and `python task3_sound_event_detection_in_real_life_audio.py -h`

The system parameters are defined in `task1_scene_classification.yaml` and `task3_sound_event_detection_in_real_life_audio.yaml`. 

With default parameter settings, the system will download needed dataset from Internet and extract it under directory `data` (storage path is controlled with parameter `path->data`). 

#### Development mode

In this mode, the system is trained and evaluated with the development dataset. This is the default operating mode. 

To run the system in this mode:
`python task1_scene_classification.py` 
or `python task1_scene_classification.py -development`.

#### Challenge mode

In this mode, the system is trained with the provided development dataset and the evaluation dataset is run through the developed system. Output files are generated in correct format for the challenge submission. The system ouput is saved in the path specified with the parameter: `path->challenge_results`.

To run the system in this mode:
`python task1_scene_classification.py -challenge`.


4. System blocks
================

The system implements following blocks:

1. Dataset initialization 
  - Downloads the dataset from the Internet if needed
  - Extracts the dataset package if needed
  - Makes sure that the meta files are appropriately formated

2. Feature extraction (`do_feature_extraction`)
  - Goes through all the training material and extracts the acoustic features
  - Features are stored file-by-file on the local disk (pickle files)

3. Feature normalization (`do_feature_normalization`)
  - Goes through the training material in evaluation folds, and calculates global mean and std of the data.
  - Stores the normalization factors (pickle files)

4. System training (`do_system_training`)
  - Trains the system
  - Stores the trained models and feature normalization factors together on the local disk (pickle files)

5. System testing (`do_system_testing`)
  - Goes through the testing material and does the classification / detection 
  - Stores the results (text files)

6. System evaluation (`do_system_evaluation`)
  - Reads the ground truth and the output of the system and calculates evaluation metrics

5. System evaluation
====================

## Task 1 - Acoustic scene classification

## Task 3 - Real life audio sound event detection

###  Metrics

**Segment-based metrics**

Segment based evaluation is done in a fixed time grid, using segments of one second length to compare the ground truth and the system output. 

- **Total error rate (ER)** is the main metric for this task. Error rate as defined in [Poliner2007](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/pubs/PoliE06-piano.pdf) will be evaluated in one-second segments over the entire test set. 

- **F-score** is calculated over all test data based on the total number of false positive, false negatives and true positives. 

**Event-based metrics**

Event-based evaluation considers true positives, false positives and false negatives with respect to event instances. 

**Definition**: An event in the system output is considered correctly detected if its temporal position is overlapping with the temporal position of an event with the same label in the ground truth. A tolerance is allowed for the onset and offset (200 ms for onset and 200 ms or half length for offset)

- **Error rate** calculated as described in [Poliner2007](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/pubs/PoliE06-piano.pdf) over all test data based on the total number of insertions, deletions and substitutions.

- **F-score** is calculated over all test data based on the total number of false positive, false negatives and true positives.

Detailed description of metrics can be found from [DCASE2016 website](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/sound-event-detection-metrics).
